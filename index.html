          <h3>Designer and Developer</h3>
          <p>I started learning coding at 19 when I was in the university because i have always loved to work with a computer and I was studying computer science. So far I have gathered much experience to design and develop websites and web applications with great user experience.</p>

          <h3>Mathematics and calculations</h3>
          <p>Mathematics has been my favourite subject since I was 8. I have always loved the thrill of finding solutions to that ugly math problem and its probably the reason why I joined science. Been long I actually did a math calculation but I'm pretty sure it's still in here somewhere.</p>

        <div class="skill-row">
          <img class="game-img" src="images/game.png" alt="video game image">
          <h3>Video games (FIFA/PES)</h3>
          <p>Another great skill I have is playing video games. Some of my favourites are FIFA, PES and Blur. Trust me, you do not want to play a football game with me but you can contact me if you want to give it a try ðŸ˜‰</p>
